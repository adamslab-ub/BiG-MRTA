def maximum_weight_full_matching(G, top_nodes=None, weight='weight'):
    r"""Returns the maximum weight full matching of the bipartite graph `G`.

    Let :math:`G = ((U, V), E)` be a complete weighted bipartite graph with
    real weights :math:`w : E \to \mathbb{R}`. This function then produces
    a maximum matching :math:`M \subseteq E` which, since the graph is
    assumed to be complete, has cardinality
   
    .. math::
       \lvert M \rvert = \min(\lvert U \rvert, \lvert V \rvert),

    and which minimizes the sum of the weights of the edges included in the
    matching, :math:`\sum_{e \in M} w(e)`.
    
    When :math:`\lvert U \rvert = \lvert V \rvert`, this is commonly
    referred to as a perfect matching; here, since we allow
    :math:`\lvert U \rvert` and :math:`\lvert V \rvert` to differ, we
    follow Karp [1]_ and refer to the matching as *full*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

      Undirected bipartite graph

    top_nodes : container

      Container with all nodes in one bipartite node set. If not supplied
      it will be computed.

    weight : string, optional (default='weight')

       The edge data key used to provide each value in the matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    matches : dictionary

      The matching is returned as a dictionary, `matches`, such that
      ``matches[v] == w`` if node `v` is matched to node `w`. Unmatched
      nodes do not occur as a key in matches.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : Exception

      Raised if the input bipartite graph is not complete.

    ImportError : Exception

      Raised if SciPy is not available.

    Notes
    -----
    The problem of determining a minimum weight full matching is also known as
    the rectangular linear assignment problem. This implementation defers the
    calculation of the assignment to SciPy.
