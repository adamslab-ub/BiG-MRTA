Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Disaster Response: Addressing Dynamic Tasks with Deadlines and Robots with Range and Payload Constraints

This repository contains data and code of our BiG-MRTA, Feas-RND, and EDF algorithms that are used to solve disaster response task allocation using a team of robots. It also contains the simulator code to test each algorithm and the flood simulator generate the data for testing scenarios. For further information on this, please refer to our paper: Ghassemi, P., and Chowdhury, S., Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Disaster Response: Addressing Dynamic Tasks with Deadlines and Robots with Range and Payload Constraints, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Elsevier.
