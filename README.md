Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Disaster Response: Addressing Dynamic Tasks with Deadlines and Robots with Range and Payload Constraints

This repository contains the implementation of three multi-robot task allocation algorithms, namely BiG-MRTA, Feas-RND, and EDF. It also contains the flood simulator to generate the data for test scenarios and the disaster response simulator to run each algorithm on a pre-computed flood scenario. For further information on this, please refer to our paper: Ghassemi, P., and Chowdhury, S., Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Disaster Response: Addressing Dynamic Tasks with Deadlines and Robots with Range and Payload Constraints, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Elsevier.
